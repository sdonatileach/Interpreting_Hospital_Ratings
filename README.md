## Interpreting Hospital Ratings

### Overview:
Every year, CMS rates every hospital registered with Medicare. The rating falls on a scale from one to five: one being the worst, five being the best. This "star rating" is derived from several different quality measures including mortality, safety, readmission, patient experience, timeliness, effectiveness of care, and efficient use of medical imaging. The measures selected come from a wide agreement among CMS, the hospital industry and public sector stakeholders.

All these quality measures are evaluated in comparison to the national average and can be distinguished as above, below or the same as the national average. For example, a hospital could be ranked as below the national average for mortality, but above the national average for patient experience.  Some hospitals may not report enough information on a quality measure for CMS to appropriately assign it a ranking.  In this case, the quality measure will be listed as "Not Available". CMS has stated that in this case, the weight of the other quality measures will increase.

The goal of this report will be to interpret which of these quality measures have the strongest impact on the hospital star rating. Additionally, the hospital is put into one of ten different categories regarding its ownership which could have an impact on the hospital star rating.

### Research questions:
  - Which quality measures have the strongest impact on hospital rating?
  -	How does the hospital rating differ for the different types of hospital ownership (e.g., Government, Non-profit, For-profit, etc.)?
  -	Does the hospital rating differ by state? Which states differ the most from other states?
