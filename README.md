## Interpreting Hospital Ratings

### Overview:
This project interprets why hospitals receive the rating they do, which falls on a scale from one to five. This score was assigned by the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services during the 2016 calendar year.  The score is derived from several different quality measures including mortality, safety, readmission, patient experience, timeliness of care and efficient use of medical imaging. All these quality measures are evaluated in comparison to the national average and can be distinguished as above, below or the same as the national average.  

### Research questions:
  - What factors are the strongest predictors of hospital rating?
  - Does the hospital rating differ by county/state? Which counties/states differ the most from other counties?
  - How does the hospital rating differ for different Hospital ownership (e.g., Government, Non-profit, For-profit, etc.)?
  - Is there any association/multicollinearity between mortality and patient experience?
  - Are there any other interesting interactions taking place between any of the predictors?
