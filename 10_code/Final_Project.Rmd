##  Interpreting Hospital Ratings Based on Quality Measures

### Summary:


### Introduction:

  -	What factors are the strongest predictors of hospital rating?
  -	Does the hospital rating differ by county/state? Which counties/states differ the most from other counties?
  -	How does the hospital rating differ for the different Hospital ownership (e.g., Government, Non-profit, For-profit, etc.)?
  -	Is there any association/multicollinearity between mortality and patient experience?
  -	Are there any other interesting interactions taking place between any of the predictors?

### EDA:

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
